INTRO

Our project is to see if we can get more members to our gym. Our goal is to determine if we can find people with poor mental and physical health and see if it relates to BMI. If we find that people with higher BMI negatively correlate with physical and mental health, we can inform people that going to the gym can help them become more fit mentally and physically.

FINDINGS

In the 2014 CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset that contained around 250,000 adults, about 12.4% of people reported ten or more poor mental health days in the last month. When we split BMI, people with a BMI greater than or equal to 40 (Class 2 obesity). The average poor-mental-health days was around 5.7 for a BMI greater than or equal to 40 and for a BMI less than 40 there was an average of 3 bad mental health days. The probability of less than 10 mental health day was 23% for a BMI greater than 40 and 12% for a BMI less than 40. A simple logistic regression using self reported general, mental, and physical health to predict obesity (a BMI greater than or equal to 30) is at about a 65% accuracy.
