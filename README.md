INTRO
	Our project is to see if we can get more members to our gym. Our goal is to determine if we can find people with poor mental and physical health and see if it relates to BMI. If we find that people with higher BMI negatively correlate with physical and mental health, we can inform people that going to the gym can help them become more fit mentally and physically.
